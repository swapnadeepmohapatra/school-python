WebAssembly is designed to maintain the versionless, feature-tested, and backwards-compatible nature of the web.
WebAssembly modules will be able to call into and out of the JavaScript context and access browser functionality
through the same Web APIs accessible from JavaScript. WebAssembly also supports non-web embeddings.
